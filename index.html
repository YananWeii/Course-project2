            <h2>Cyberpunk 2077</h2>
            <img src="img/logo-cyberpunk.png" alt="" class="logo">
            <p>Cyberpunk 2077 is an action role-playing game developed by CD Projekt RED for PC, Xbox and PS4 on
                December
                10, 2020. Cyberpunk 2077 takes place in the City of Night, where a change of power and physical
                transformation are constant themes. Players will take on the role of an ambitious mercenary: V, in
                pursuit
                of a unique implant - the key to immortality. Customise your character's prosthetic body, skills and
                play
                style and explore the all-encompassing city. The choices players make will also have an impact on
                the
                plot
                and the world around them.</p>
        </div>

        <h3>Game Setting</h3>
        <div class="text-small">
            <p>In Cyberpunk 2077's overhead worldview, the United States has been torn apart by a series of wars
                and
                terrorist attacks in the late 20th century, leaving the federal government extremely vulnerable.
                Major
                multinational high-tech corporations have taken advantage of the situation and taken control of
                every
                aspect
                of people's lives, and the gap between the rich and the poor has become wider than ever.
                Peasants
                lost
                their land to takeover and annexation by large corporations, and ended up roaming the big cities
                in
                family units as paramilitary organisations; the lower and middle classes were separated from
                their families
                by mass unemployment, and ended up forming street gangs. The workplace is a dangerous and
                deceitful
                environment.
                The player will choose from one of these three backgrounds and begin the journey.</p>

            <h3>Introduction to the main character</h3>
            <p>The protagonist of Cyberpunk 2077 is V. V is the character that the player has to control and at the
                beginning of the game, three identities of V are provided and the player will choose one of them to
                start
                the game. The different identities will not only determine how the player starts the game, but will
                also
                in
                some way affect the protagonist's relationship with several other major characters.</p>

            <h3>V Three identities available to the player</h3>
            <p>(Vagabond): wandering the badlands, raiding scrapyards, plundering oil depots and making a living on
                the
                highways. Raised by a family of vagabonds. Honesty, integrity, and a love of freedom.</p>
            <p>(Street Kid): Raised on a hundred families and living life on the streets. Lived among gangs,
                middlemen,
                sex couples and uncouth drug dealers. Living in the city of the night where the underdog is strong
                and
                has
                the law of the jungle.</p>
            <p>(company employee): experienced a lot, flexible, profiting from other people's secrets, intelligence
                is
                the weapon in hand. There is no such thing as fair play, only success and failure.</p>

        <h2>Ghostrunner</h2>
        <div class="text-small">
            <img src="img/gg.jpg" alt="" class="logo">
            <p>Ghostrunner is a first-person perspective hardcore decapitation game that combines lightning-fast action
                with
                violent combat, set in a cyberpunk mega-building in a harsh environment. It tells the story of a world
                that
                has ended, and its inhabitants who are fighting to survive in it. Players will act as the most advanced
                blade warriors, you are always outnumbered and never outmatched. Slice and dice enemies with your
                monomolecular katana, dodge bullets with your super human reflexes and use a plethora of special skills
                to
                win in sparring matches.</p>

            <img src="img/Ghostrunner-1.gif" alt="">

            <p>In the earlier demo, Ghostrunner blindly listened to the 'whispers in his head' as he made his way
                through
                the bottom of Dharma Tower, ending with a meeting between the two. Now we know that the big blue head is
                called Architect, and it will guide you through the journey.</p>

            <p>Also singled out is the game's villain, the Dr. Octopus-like character at the end of the trailer, the
                scientist Mara, known as the Keymaster. Like many power-hungry villains, Mara will do anything to take
                control of Dharmata, eliminating anyone who gets in her way. There are brief hints that she nearly
                killed
                the Ghostwalker, and the Builder will help you reclaim your many lost abilities and prepare you for your
                destined encounter with Mara. From the bottom to the top, players will take revenge against the tyrant
                Keymaster.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="text-small">
            <h3>Game Setting</h3>
            <p>The tip of the iceberg in the earlier demo version of Dharma Tower, and this bottom area is simply to
                familiarise players with the action and pre-requisite abilities such as Sensory Boost (similar to
                bullet
                time) and grappling hook. As you climb and jump and evade the chase, you'll encounter a variety of
                enemies
                and dangers. The only things that will keep you alive are your own powerful cybernetic body and the
                deadly
                blade in your hand, which you can use to kill your enemies with a single swipe.</p>

            <p>One of the most interesting aspects of the gameplay is that when taking damage, the player also kills
                in
                one
                hit. The combat is therefore somewhat similar to that of SUPERHOT VR, where every action you take is
                crucial. So that players will not give up on this game by dying all the time, the death experience
                is
                made
                less sadistic by the fact that when the player unfortunately dies, they immediately respawn at the
                initial
                location of each archive node. I experienced the pain of dying in front of a storage point and
                having to
                replay it!</p>

            <p>Each session is like a puzzle in a platformer, where the player must manoeuvre with precision while
                avoiding
                incoming enemy fire. It's not easy to do this, but the good thing is that each death allows the
                player
                to
                learn from experience and adjust their strategy to try again. While killing enemies feels great, it
                can
                get
                annoying to keep repeating the same levels over and over again!</p>

            <img src="img/t.webp" alt="" class="logo">

            <h3>PMC</h3>
            <h3>BEAR</h3>

                class="">

            <img src="img/Escape_from_Tarkov_USEC_Private_military_corporation_simple_dark-1600385.jpg" alt="" class="">
            <p>In PMC mode, you will take on the role of a main character employed by USEC or BEAR. You will be born in
                the
                chosen map immediately at the start of the battle and carry the items and equipment you have equipped
                for
                the main character in your hideout. As a PMC player, you can kill other PMC players or Scav scavengers.
                To
                survive and evacuate from the battlefield with all your items, you must find and enter an available
                evacuation point. Double click on the O to see the evacuation point.</p>
            <p>You can use the equipment in the hideout.</p>
            <p>You can kill PMC and Scav.</p>
            <p>You must evacuate to keep the items you have gained during the battle.</p>
            <p>If you die or exceed the evacuation time, you will lose all items brought into the battle (except melee
                weapons and items in the safe)</p>
            <p>Experience gained in the battle will count towards the main character's level experience</p>
            <p>Quests can be completed</p>
        </div>
        <div class="text-small">
            <h3>Scav</h3>
            <p>In Scav mode, you will play as a member of the Scav camp. You will be given random equipment (usually low
                level or unbalanced) and will be born halfway through the game (and without a message). Nevertheless,
                Scav
                mode has its advantages; the AI Scavs will not attack you unless you make the first move, and sometimes
                they
                will even go along with your actions. On top of this, Scav mode is free, which means you don't have to
                risk
                losing items as you do when playing as the PMC. However, Scav must also find and enter an extraction
                point,
                just like the PMC, in order to withdraw from the battle and transfer the loot. However, please note that
                the
                experience gained while playing as Scav does not go into the main PMC character experience; any
                experience
                gained in the battle will be lost and you can only complete the 'find items' category.</p>
            <p>You will be given random equipment and it will be different each time.</p>
            <p>You will be born halfway through the game with only limited information.</p>
            <p>You can kill the PMC and Scav, but the Scav will not actively attack you.</p>
            <p>You will lose all items equipped to your Scav character upon death or after the evacuation time.</p>
            <p>Cannot complete any quests other than finding items.</p>
